                <p>Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire.</p>

                <p>And this
                    difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress
                    has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which persons
                    and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of
                    their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away
                    traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the
                    revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from
                    attractive superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in.

                <p>It is unfortunate
                    for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know least, and talk
                    most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere have,
                    perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of
                    mankind than any other three writers who could be named, and yet the
                    history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of
                    discussion, which has left us little save the option of choosing
                    which theory or theories we will follow. The personality of
                    Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us
